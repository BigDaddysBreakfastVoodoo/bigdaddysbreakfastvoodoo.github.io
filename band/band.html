    <h2>About the Band</h2>

    <p>
      Big Daddy’s Breakfast Voodoo was never built in a straight line. 
      It grew out of jam sessions, bad ideas that turned out right, 
      riffs that refused to leave, and rhythms that felt better than thinking.
      Somewhere in the swamp where Stoner Blues meets raw nerve,
      Mike (guitar & vocals), Peter (bass), and Bart (drums) found a sound that stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since 2013, the band has been shaping songs the same way they live them — 
      hands-on, instinct-driven, and slightly unhinged.
      Hand-built amps, guitars, and pedals feed a blues core that stays honest, 
      while rock, funk, punk, and whatever crawls out of the mud get pulled into the mix.
      Nothing is planned too far ahead, and nothing is polished to death.
    </p>

    <p>
      On stage and on record, the music comes straight from lived experience: 
      workdays, road miles, family chaos, bad choices, hindsight, and the occasional revelation.
      Playing regularly since 2015 in bars, motorcycle gatherings, and festivals,
      Big Daddy’s Breakfast Voodoo delivers a cure for predictable blues.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is who we are. If you get it, you’re already in.

Surviving by rhythmic assaults and sheer chaos, Bart was welcomed by Peter and Mike on the promise that in-laws were shared to ease pressure. The rest is history...`,
      mike: `Mike [pronounced MAYHK] a.k.a Ginger or Soulless - Produces insane guitar riffs and hypnotizing vocals. Nobody knows where he came from. Some say he emerged from the remains of a dead harlot, chased by a pack of musical dogs. The guitar became part of his anatomy at birth; the microphone was thrust upon him by Peter and Bart.`,
      peter: `Peter [PEE-ter] a.k.a Nonkel Peer - Player of mesmerizing bass grooves. Born as the eldest son of a wealthy family, he rebelled and left home. After wandering aimlessly for years, he was adopted by a pack of dogs that somehow played awesome music. Here, Peter learned to master the bass like a madman.`
