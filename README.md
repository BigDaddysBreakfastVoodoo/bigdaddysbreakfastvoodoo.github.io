Big Daddy’s Breakfast Voodoo was never built in a straight line. 
It grew out of jam sessions, bad ideas that turned out right, riffs that refused 
to leave, and rhythms that felt better than thinking. Somewhere in the swamp 
where StonerBlues meets raw nerve.

Since 2013, the band has been shaping songs the same way they live them: hands-on, 
instinct-driven, and slightly unhinged. Hand-built amps, guitars, and pedals feed a 
blues core that stays honest, while rock, funk, punk, and whatever crawls out of 
the mud get pulled into the mix. Nothing is planned too far ahead, and nothing 
is polished to death.
