Go... go the fuck to sleep
I know I got stories to read
Next to your room, there are babies to feed
Just lie down, close your eyes, let us be
Please, oh please, go the fuck to sleep
I know my babies are not to blame
Three minutes of fun turned out to be a mighty shame
Just lie down, close your eyes, let us be
Please, oh please, go the fuck to sleep
I know I got some chores to do, my dear
All the kids are asleep
My frustration is mighty clear
Just let me be in my shed
Let me fuck around with my bikes
So baby, go the fuck to sleep
I know I got stories to read
All the time there is some kiss of fear
Just lie down, let us be, close your eyes
Please, oh please, go the fuck to sleep
