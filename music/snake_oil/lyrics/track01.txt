Woke up this morning
Face in the bowl
I didn't know where I was
My bed ain't that small
'Cause I was huggin'
Huggin' that bowl again
You know it is Friday
When you're huggin' that bowl again
Dogs started barking
Doorbell rang, hell
What's up, what's down
Just couldn't tell
'Cause I was huggin'
Huggin' that bowl again
You know it is Saturday
When you're huggin' that bowl again
In came the in-laws
With their old people's nag
I tried to act nice
But I started to gag
'Cause I was huggin'
Huggin' that bowl again
You know it's time to quit taking shots
When you're huggin' that bowl again
