Went to the doctor, pain in my gut
Are you ready for pain and whatnot
He started probing, feeling, pulling all up my ass
If I knew then what I know now
Then I shouldn't have said yes
Minding my business
There was a girl I once knew
Do you remember me from nine months ago?
There was a baby, a stroller, diapers
Oh what a mess
If I knew then what I know now
Then I shouldn't have said yes
Doing some building
Building me a porch
Wife tried to help me, oh what a joy
xxxxx
If I knew then what I know now
Then I shouldn't have said yes
