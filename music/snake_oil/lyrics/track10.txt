Take a listen
Before I break down
Pull the lid down

Run round
You got to handle the hell in here
Run round
You got to handle the shit in here

Before I break down
Pull your tit down (???)
Before I lay down xxxxx (???)
Run round
You got to handle the hell in here
Run round
You got to handle the shit in here
Take a listen
Before I break down
Burn your lay down (???)
Put your foot down xxxxx (???)
Run round
You got to handle the hell in here
Run round
You got to handle the shit in here
Take your tone down
When I sit down
Be your xxxxx

Run round
You got to handle the hell in here
Run round
You got to handle the shit in here


(BONUS TRACK - CONSTIPATION BLUES)
I got me some constipation blues
Let it go
I got a feeling in my bowl
It is screaming, "Let me out"
I got me some constipation blues
Let it go, ah let it go
It's gonna be alright
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
Let it go, ah let it go
I got me some constipation blues
And it ain't xxx
[Assorted screams and toilet noises]
Let it go, yeah let it go
I got a screaming, "Let me out"
Let it go
Let it go, yeah let it go
I got me some constipation blues
And it is stinging me in my bowl
Yeah let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it go
