I know a woman down south
She ain't got teeth in her mouth
She has a house in the swamp
It kind of looks like a dump
Yeah, looks like a dump
Baba Yaga is home
That woman down south
She has only xxxxx
She has a house with four paws

Baba Yaga is home
That woman down south
She ain't got no teeth in her mouth
She'll suck the soul from your child
You better look like you die (?????)

She'll run with all her four paws
She'll suck up your soul
Suck up your soul
Baba Yaga is home
That woman down south
She ain't got teeth in her mouth

She'll be looking for yours
