Life is like a big adventure
Standing in the corner
With only one fucking string (?????)
It ain't the despair
Torture never stops
When I was a little younger
A little more eager than today
Life was a big fucking adventure
Something
I want xxxxx
It ain't the despair
Torture never stops
Hope is like some sausage
Dangling in front of my face
Maybe we'll ride to Oblivia ?????
xxxx
On a road leading no fucking way????
It ain't the despair
Torture never stops
Hope is like some mirage
Making me see things that ain't there
Making me run to nowhere
That's the way I stay ???
It ain't the despair
Torture never stops
