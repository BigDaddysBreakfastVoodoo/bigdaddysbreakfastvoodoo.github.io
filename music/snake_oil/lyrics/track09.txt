You dawg, don't pee on my rug
You dawg, with your scruffy coat
You dawg xxxxx
You dawg xxxxx
I should have left you by the road
Instead, I took you right into my home
You just give me back my bone
You dawg, your leash is too long
You dawg, your collar is too loose
You dawg, you give me the shit
You dawg, you give me the blues
I should have left you by the road
Instead, I took you right into my home
You just give me back my bone
You dawg, don't pee on my rug
You dawg, with your scruffy coat
You dawg xxxxx
You dawg xxxxx
I should have left you by the road
Instead, I took you right into my home
You just give me back my bone
