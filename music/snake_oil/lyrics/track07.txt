I am the Big Bad Wolf
And I am on the prowl
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
You hear me growl
Start running
Though you can't hide
Beware now
I'm going out tonight
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I'm on the prowl
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
You hear me howl
Red Riding Hood
Going down tonight
Little piggies
Be my chop tonight
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I'm on the prowl
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
You'll hear me howl
I'm a ginger baby
I ain't got no soul
Remember now
There ain't no control
And your grandma too
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I'm on the prowl
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
You'll hear me howl
Little piggies
Be my chop tonight
Little Riding Hood
Going down tonight
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I'm on the prowl
I'm the Big Bad Wolf
You'll hear me howl
I'm a ginger baby
I ain't got no soul
Remember now
There ain't no control
