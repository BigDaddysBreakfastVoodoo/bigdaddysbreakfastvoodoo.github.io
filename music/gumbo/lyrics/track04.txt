I am the broom
I sweep the floor
I’ll clear the room
to store some more
I will make it shine
I will make yours mine

I am the broom
Sweep you off the floor
brush you in my bag
Till it ain't no more
This here blue bag
will be your home

I am the broom
I sweep the floor
I’ll clear the room
to store some more
I will make it shine
I will make yours mine

Can't bear the look of all the crap around here
you make me wanna dispose of you
I don’t wanna, there’s a no choice so clear
I’ll use my brush and every means to
I’ll clean you up, make you go
This here blue bag will be your home

I’ll clear the room to store some more
I’ll make you shine, I’ll make yours mine

Can't bear the look of all the crap around here
you make me wanna dispose of you
I don’t wanna, there’s a no choice so clear
I’ll use my brush and every means to
