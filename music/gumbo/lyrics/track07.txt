Went to church on Sunday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah
Did the dishes Monday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah

Oh, but when it’s dark
I celebrate
My naked body
Head into town
Prancing around
I look great in stockings

Took the trash out Tuesday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah
Mowed the lawn on Wednesday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah

Oh, but when itʼs dark
I celebrate
My naked body
Head into town
Prancing around
I look great in stockings

Volunteered on Thursday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah
Saved some kittens on Friday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah

Oh, but when it’s dark
I celebrate
My naked body
Head into town
Prancing around
I look great in stockings

Washed the car on Saturday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah
Went to church on Sunday
Ainʼt no time for fun play
From the path I won’t stray
Oh, until the lights go out yeah

Oh, but when it’s dark
I celebrate
My naked body
Head into town
