Parked my car in the water
Water is leaking through the floor
Missed a turn and she was flying
Now my car she is no more

Wicked
Wicked

Moonlight is shining on her carcass
Such a fucking pretty sight
Fireflies twirling all around her
Set her body flaming bright

Wicked
Wicked

Rolled a spliff to taste the moment
Mellowness is sinking in
No police to find around here
I’m completely free of sin

Wicked
Wicked

Left my lighter on the dashboard
Fuck it’s time for me to swim
Hope there ain’t no alligators
That would make things rather grim

Wicked
Wicked
She’s going down

Parked my car in the water
Water is leaking through the floor
Missed a turn and she was flying
Now my car she is no more

Wicked
Wicked
She’s going down

Down, down, down, down,
down, down, down
DOWN
