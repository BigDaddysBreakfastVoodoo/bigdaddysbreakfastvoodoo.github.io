Stuck in a pool full of beaver
Slaving to build them a home
Trying to be a beaver pleaser
Chopping my wood all alone

Come on, Come on, Come on
Be an eager beaver, Come on
Come on, Come on,
Be an eager beaver, Come on

Dancing around with some zebras
Blending right with their herd
Nasty buggers like hyenas
Seeing things all black and white

Come on, Come on, Come on
Dance with the zebras, Come on
Come on, Come on,
Dance with the zebras, Come on

Running around with the cheetahs
Hunting for some easy pray
Bastards, I cannot keep up
The fuckers are running away

Come on, Come on, Come on
To hell with the cheetahs, Come on
Come on, Come on,
To hell with the cheetahs, Come on
