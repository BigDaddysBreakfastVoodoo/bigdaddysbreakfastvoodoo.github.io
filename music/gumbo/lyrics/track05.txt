Mount Jacobi shack, want the trolly back
Mount Jacobi shack, don’t want to hurt my back
Mount Jacobi shack, want the heating back
Mount Jacobi shack, we freeze our asses off

there’s crap on the floor
one big eyesore
gotta kick in the door
the fridge full no more

there’s crap on the floor
one big eyesore
gotta kick in the door
the fridge full no more
The rats flee the ship
Are planning to skip
the rent is through the roof
it’s time to move

Mount Jacobi shack, never going back
Mount Jacobi shack, the best place until now
Mount Jacobi shack, monkey on my back
Mount Jacobi shack, we are stuck in really deep

my microphone is gone
PA squeals along
I don’t know what is wrong
I fuck up this song

my microphone is gone
PA squeals along
I don’t know what is wrong
I fuck up this song
Speaker grill shot
the cables a knot
stolen no proof
it’s time to move

Mount Jacobi shack, want the trolly back
Mount Jacobi shack, don’t want to hurt my back
Mount Jacobi shack, want the heating back
Mount Jacobi shack, we freeze our asses off

Speaker grill shot
the cables a knot
Stolen no proof
It’s time to move

The rats flee the ship
Are planning to skip
the rent is through the roof
it’s time to move
