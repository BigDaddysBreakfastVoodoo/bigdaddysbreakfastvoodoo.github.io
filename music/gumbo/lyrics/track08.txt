On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

Something’s biting my leg
We gotta wait for miss Shaun
We gotta stash this meth
I think we better call Saul

On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

I’m running through the dark
There are some stranger things here
Teen wolf all bite and no bark
And Lucifer is kinda queer

On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

Sons of Anarchy
There ain’t no time for no sleep
Two seasons in one day
I’m really in too deep

On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Into the Netflix lockdown

On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Into the Netflix lockdown

Take me back
Take me back
Take me back
Into the Netflix lockdown

On Netflix lockdown
My couch is my home
On Netflix lockdown
I’m stuck in the zone
On Netflix lockdown
My mind is all gone
On Netflix lockdown
Binge-watching flow

Something’s biting my leg
We gotta wait for miss Shaun
We gotta stash this meth
I think we better call Saul
