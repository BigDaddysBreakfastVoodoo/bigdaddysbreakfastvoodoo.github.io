Staggering around at a party
Trying to hold on
Why did I have to take that blue pill
I feel like something is going wrong

I take a big gulp, what is this here
Fuck, ash in my beer
… Ash in my beer

Staggering through hordes of people
They wouldn’t get out of my way
This shit couldn’t kick in at worst places
Guess this paranoia is going to stay

Trying to wash it down, with my beer
Fuck, ash in my beer
… Ash in my beer

Oh yeah, it’s gonna be okay
Just a walk with some weird feeling
My hands are fading away
Grip on reality completely fails
When will these fuzzy martians go away
Wondering why
Wondering why
Wondering why
When will these shrooms wear off

I take a big gulp, what is this here
Fuck, ash in my beer
… Ash in my beer
