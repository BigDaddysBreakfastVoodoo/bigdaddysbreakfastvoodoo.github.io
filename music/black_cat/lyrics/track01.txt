Pushing my trolly around this old town
Fealing 'bit hazey but I'm getting 'round
Basically happy 'bout the way I'm livin'
Just need some booze to keep me walking 'round

Almost there... all through the night getting there!

Creeping and crawlin' with my booze lovin' eyes
Almost choking on a block of ice
Taking my chances stealing drinks unattended
I get snacked but I get my buzz

Almost there... all through the night getting there!
