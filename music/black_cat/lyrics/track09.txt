Drinking on the front porch makes me scream and shout
Shooting signs, frying rats, that’s what it’s about
And yeah, I like my cardboard wine

Curled up in my motorhome everything is fine
Beer at breakfast, processed food, everything deep-fried
Yelling at my stupid neighbour, now we’re gonna fight
And yeah, I like my cardboard wine
