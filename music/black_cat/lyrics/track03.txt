We roll our dice
Day by day
Stormy weather doesn’t make us stay

Oh we are gonna make it alright
We are gonna be okay

Knee-deep snow
Leads our way
We head on out, even if we stray

Oh we are gonna make it alright
We are gonna be okay

You cross our path
Run you down
Killed by death in your own hometown

Oh we are gonna make it alright
We are gonna be okay

Far from home
Stagger on
We don’t know where we’re coming from

Oh we are gonna make it alright
We are gonna be okay
