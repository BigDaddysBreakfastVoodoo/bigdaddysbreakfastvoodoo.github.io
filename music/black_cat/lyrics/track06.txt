There’s a bold old man naggin’ ‘cause we do our thing
It’s hard, it’s loud, it makes his sad ears ring
Hold on old man, you’ll never gonna stop us sing

From the back of the bar he is giving us the evil eye
The more he hears, the more it is making him sigh
Go home old man, and cry cry cry

There’s a woman up front and she’s getting pulled away
She wants to dance, but her man doesn’t want to stay
Go home on your own, and let her have her way

Now the bar is empty and it looks we don’t get paid
But the fridge is full and for the end we cannot wait
Post-party shot is why we played
(and if you don’t like it, here is my one-eyed snake)
