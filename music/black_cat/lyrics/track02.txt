I got my guitars
Pedals too
We’ve got our symbals
Base cab too

But I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
Woah I’m looking for gas

Tyres are flaming
Engine oil
Battery charged
What’s the foil

But I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
Woah I’m looking for gas

We left in time,
But we stopped, I don’t know why
Something is wrong now

I got my guitars
Pedals too
We’ve got our symbals
Base cab too

But I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
I’m looking for gas
Woah I’m looking for gas
