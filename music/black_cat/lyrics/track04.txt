I fear I’m gonna dance now
Just watch me move
I move my right foot now
Y’all get in the groove

Let your booty roll and your hips go
Come on everybody do the bag of bones
Let's move your ass, let your body flow now
Come on everybody do the bag of bones

I'll try to move my left foot
I'll let it loose
Blazing fire on the dancefloor
Let's do the goose

Let your booty roll and your hips go
Come on everybody do the bag of bones
Let's move your ass, let your body flow now
Come on everybody do the bag of bones

I fear I’m gonna dance now
Just watch me move
I move my right foot now
Y’all get in the groove

Let your booty roll and your hips go
Come on everybody do the bag of bones
Let's move your ass, let your body flow now
Come on everybody do the bag of bones
